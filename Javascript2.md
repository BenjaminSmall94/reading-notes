# Javascript 2

## Control Flow

Javascript like the majority of other modern programming langauges runs sequentially from the top to bottom, left to right. However frequently there are various control structures (eg loops or conditionals) that will cause certain lines or sets of lines to be repeated or skipped.

## Functions

Javascript implements functions. These are a way to factor your code to decrease rewrtten code and ease readability by furthering abstraction. Functions lie dormant until invoked by an executed line of code. They usually require parameters to be passed in to the function as well as return a value of alter the state of certain variables. Variables that are declared within a function cannot be accessed from outside the function.
