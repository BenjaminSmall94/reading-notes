## NoSQL vs SQL

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| --- | --- |
| Relational Database | Non Relational or distributed Database |
| Table Base | Document Based, not necessarily rows and columns |
| Predefined Schema | Dynamic Schema for unstructured data |
| Vertically Scalable | Horizontally Scalable |
| Use SQL queries to manipulate data | Queries are focues on a collection of documents and varies from database to datbase |

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
   A set of data where complex queries are frequently required.

3. Give a real world example.
   Filtering through millions of user data to find users that meet multiple criteria relevant to certain ads

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
   Data that follows hierachical structure

5. Give a real world example.
   A database for storing data about a family tree of everyone who has ever lived

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
   NoSQL

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
   Depends if you mean vertical or horizontal. Vertical Scalability goes to SQL and horizontal scalability goes to NoSQL

## SQL vs NoSQL Video

1. What does SQL stand for?
   Structured Query Language

1. What is a relational database?
   Where multiple tables of data are linked by relational tables.

1. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
   Structured data with a strong schema

1. What is a ‘schema’?
   It is a structure that a set of data must follow.

1. What is a NoSQL database?
   MongoDB

1. How does it work?
   Instead of tables it uses collections that do not have to use the same schema

1. What is inside of a Mongo database?
   Collections similar to JSON objects.

1. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   MongoDB becuase you don't have to follow a specific schema

1. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
   You don't have as powerful of queries, but can store a lot of data and add remove and change it far easier.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to get practice using all the accessing for reading and writing to databases.
