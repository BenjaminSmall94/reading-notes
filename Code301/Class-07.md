## REST Story

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

   A man who helped write the first web servers and deeply researched why the web works how it does.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

   They weren't designed for this. When these protocols were being developed computers only needed to talk to a small number of other computers at a time.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

   It's all about applying verbs to nouns. That is applying a small set of instructions(verbs) to vastly different resources, such as images, videos, text, images etc (nouns).

4. What does a `GET` do?

   Gets a piece of data from a resource

5. What does a `POST` do?

   Add a new piece of information to another system

6. What does `PUT` do?

   Replaces a piece of data on a server.

7. What does `PATCH` do?

   Does a partial update of an item on a server.
