## Component Based Architecture

A component is a small well defined partitions of a webpage that represent an encapsulated single section of the page. It not only encapsulates the look of a page but the functions, properties, and interactivity of it. They are reusabile, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent. This framework provides more data abstraction and allows for component reusability. This in turn provides additional benefits of reduced time in market and therefore development cost as well as reduction in errors while using tried and true components opposed to recreating the wheel every time. Other advantages.

> Advantages
>Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
>
>Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
>
>Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.
>
>Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
>
>Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
>
>Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
>
>System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
>
>Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

## Props and React

Props is short for properties and an is the vehicle by which React components pass data between one another. Props is a keyword in react that stands for properties. But just like React, props exercise a one-way flow of information. First you define a value in the parents element, access it in the child element with the props keyword and then render the props data.

## Introducing JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for new datatypes as elements. Instead of separating logic and behavoir from UI, React combines the two and then separates items based on function/concerns. You can then embed any valid javascript expressions inside an element by wrapping them in curly brackets. JSX also prevents injection attacks since React DOM automatically escapes any embedded values that need to be escaped.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I just want to get into the technology and do some hands on practice. Especially after a lecture session I'll be good to go and get some great practice using this technology!
