## That TIme When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
   Personal computers started to show up in people's home and this was accompanied by a strong marketing campaign geared towards mean as well as a general entertainment media narrative of computers being for boys.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
   In the 80's after the proliferation of the personal computer, all the students in intro classes already had experience with computers so professors assumed students in their classes already had experience, which was true for the male students but not for their female counterparts.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
   Diverse people are usually diverse thinkers and therefore bring more solutions to the table to fit any scenario the company might face.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
   Having more women on a team allows the team to develop products that serve women better becuase they better understand what women require. The reading gave a similar example about left-handed people!
