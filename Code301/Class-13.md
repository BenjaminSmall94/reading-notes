## Speed Coding: Building a CRUP API

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
   REST describes a server-client application that interacts with one another in an independent and intelligible way. CRUD describes the four most basic actions that occur between a client and a server. 

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
   1. Setup dependencies/middleware
   2. Define Schema
   3. Setup Routes in server
   4. Build Front-End Interaction
   5. Have fun!
