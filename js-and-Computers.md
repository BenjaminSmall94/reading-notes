# Javascript and How Computers Work

[Home](index.html)

## What is Javascript

Javascript is a lightweight interpreted programming language that is distributed by Oracle. It is the Holy Grail for adding functionality to the modern web. However it can be and is still be used in situations outside of the internet.

## Variables in Javascript

### Declaring Variables

There are four ways to declare variables in javascript.

- using `var` \(2015 and before)
- using `let` \(used from variabled that are expected to change over the course of the program execution)
- using `const` \(used for constant values)
- unsing nothing \(bad form)

The Javascript interpreter handles all the data-typing and allows the developed just to simply assign any value to a declared and unaasigned variables.

### Javascript Data Types

JavaScript variables consist as primitive values and objects.

- Primitive values (immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language).
  - Boolean type
  - Null type
  - Undefined type
  - Number type
  - BigInt type
  - String type
  - Symbol type
- Objects (more complex object that are often user defined)

## Computer Basics

### Operations of Computers

For all of history, computers have performed four basic tasks.

- Recieve input
- Store information
- Process information
- Provide Output

### Modern Computers

Modern Computers do all four of these tasks via electronic signals encoded and decoded as 1's and 0's (current in wire, or not).

### Modern Coding

Thankfully, coding nowadays has does not involve manually entering 1's and 0's into a computer. Generation of coders before us have constructed frameworks using these tedious methods so that current developers can write code in text that resembles intelligible speech or literature. These programming languages are built on programs themselves that either compile or interpret this high-level code into bite code which is intelligible to a computer.
