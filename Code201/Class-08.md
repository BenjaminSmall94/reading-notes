## CSS Layout (Online Reading)

### History of CSS

Before the mid 90's developers had almost no tools to change the look of their website beyond the basic strucurze of HTML. With the advent of CSS, Developers had a whole separate arsenal of tools to use to make a website pleasing to visit and easy to follow.

### Display Types

- Individual Elements: Inline and Box are the two original primary displays
- Multiple Elements: Flexbox and Grid

#### Flewbox

Flex box is a one dimensional layout tool that synchronizes layout across a single access and by default stretches elements to fit across the other access. It converts all child elements to **flex items** enabling you to write rules about how they behave within the container from the container ruleset itself.

#### Grid

Grid is similar in many ways to Flexbox, however it is used to synchronize elements across a two-dimensional layout. Grid gives you precis control over their two-dimensional placement and size.

#### Flow Layout

If you are not using Flexbox or Grid, then (with a few exceptions) you are placing items in the normal flow of the webpage. Using inline-blocks and floats can be very helpful when building layouts in the normal flow. Additionally for lists and other elements you can use the `column-count` attribute to make multiple columns. Lastly using the position property will be vital to building layouts in the normal flow.

## Things I want to know more about

I really am just looking forward to getting more practice with CSS. I know I don't have to be a designer and it's not 100% up my wheel house, but have a visual eye for what looks pretty is valuable too and I have enjoyed working on that even though it's traditionally not my strong suit.
