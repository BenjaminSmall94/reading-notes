## CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

The transform property gave people a new way to size, position, and change elements. It comes in two different settings, 2D, and 2D. As far as sytax it just involves the key and value `transform: value;`.

### 2D Transforms

Elements are distorted or transformed in a 2D plane.

- 2D Rotate: `transform: rotate(20deg);`
- 2D Scale: `transform: scale(1.25);`, `transform: scaleX(.75)`, `transform: scale(.75, 1.25);`
- 2D Translate: `transform: translateY(125px);`, `transform: translateX(75%)`, `transform: translate(75%, 125px);`
- 2D Skew: `transform: skewY(125deg);`, `transform: skewX(75deg)`, `transform: skew(75%, 125px);`
- `transform-origin`

### 3D Transforms

All the same methods work in 3D as well but now in the Z-direction, but now you have backface visibility which can be set to hidden.

## Transitions and Animations

### Transitions

There are four transition related properties

1. transition-property: specifies the property to have the transition applied to
2. transition-duration: specifies how long the duration will take
3. transition-timing-function:
4. transition-delay

### Animations

You can use keyframe animation, and then apply them to certain pseudo classes in HTML with the following properties

1. `animation-name`
2. `animation-duration`
3. `animation-timing-funciton`
4. `animation-delay`
5. `animation-iteration-count`
6. `animation-direction`
7. `animation-play-state`
8. `animation-fill-mode`

With just these simple functions, you can create effects that will wow users!

## Google's Quest for the Perfect Team

- All good teams had about equate share in talking "conversational turn-taking"b **Communication**
- ALl good teams had high "average social sensitivity" **Empathy**
- making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability

These both feed into Psycological Safety or "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up".

Letting your guard down can build closer relations and help cue people in on each others emotions.
