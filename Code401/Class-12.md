[Home](../index.md)

## Object Creation

- Create a series by passing in a list of values
- Create a dataFrame by passing in a NumPy Array or a Map

### Data Frame data types

- float64
- datetime64[ns]
- float32
- int32
- category
- object

Viewing Data

- `df.head()`
- `df.tail()`
- `df.index()`
- `df.columns()`
- `df.describe()`

Bottom Line Panda has a ton of resources for working with data specifically in matrices or tensors. It is essential for data science in python. It makes excel obsolete!

## Things I Want to Know More About

I really want to get on the panda train and see all the benefits and applications in can have in the data science realm! It is exciting to know a whole new world of possibilities awaits!
