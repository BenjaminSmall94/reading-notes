# Classes, Objects, Recursion, and Testing

[Home](../index.md)

## Classes and Objects

Classes are templates to create objects from. Objects are a collection of methods and variables representing a real life concept. Classes encapsulating objects generally have constructors. In python this concept is employed through the `__init__` function. You can assign a class to and Object variable simply by using the equals sign. Accessing object variables and methods employs the dot notation.

## Thinking Recursively

Recursion is a computer programming concept that invovles a function calling itself until reaching a base case which then triggers a series of returns which unravels the recursive stack and ultimately reaches a final answer. Factorial and fibonacci series and popular examples of mathematical concepts that lend themselves quite readily to recursion.

One weakness, that is quite large in my mind is the fact that recursion can quite easily cause a stack overflow if 'n' grows to a moderately large size.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

Fixtures are pieces of code in your testing suite that reoccur frequently. This tool makes it easy to access the code within all your test without having to rewrite code redundantly.

Coverage is the testing concept of ensuring you have tested all possible areas of your code and distint inputs to ensure that when your test pass you have the highest likelihood of actually having deployable code.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to know more about writing good tests and employing the fixture tool of pytest. I read about it but am having a hard time visualizing it in practical use.
