# JupyterLab and Numpy

[Home](../index.md)

## JupyterLab

> JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

### Text, Code Consoles, & Terminals

- Syntax Highlighting
- Customizable indentation
- Code console: right click and select a kernel

### Common Formats

- Popular image formats are supports as single images and notebooks
- .csv files are highly supported

### Jupyter Notebooks

- New way to work easily with Data and code seamlessly
- Works with two modes: Command (Default) and Edit

## NumPy

> NumPy is a commonly used python data analysis package.

The old way of doing often required using the csv reader package and object in python and was a lot more cod intensive.

NumPy is excellent at working with one, two, or multi-dimensional arrays and has numerous helpful methods to achieve this.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to see this NumPy in action. I think that lecture and/or lab will really help to solidify all the concepts and capabilities associated with NumPy.
