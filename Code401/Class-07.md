## Python Scope

Scope is the concept that determines how variables are looked up in a program. It determines where are certain variable can be seen. LEGB guides Python scope (Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in). Understanding this will help you avoid bugs from name collision and poorly named global variables.

> - Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.
>
> - Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

Scope originated because early programs only had global scope, which made debugging these programs a nightmare!

Names come into existence through several key ways:

- Assignments
- Imports
- Function definitions
- As parameters
- Class definitions

Python names are stored in a map implementing a dictionary.
