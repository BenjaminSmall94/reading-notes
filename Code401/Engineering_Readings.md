## Act Like you make $1,000/hr

Sometimes I find myself feeling pressured to say yes to things that are not a good use of my time. Sometimes the people who are asking for it are not even that thankful when I do it. Other times it just comes from internal pressure I put on myself to do x or y things that are not the best use of my time. You really have very little time on this Earth and "wasting" it by pursuing something other than what brings you joy or that you are passionate about is inexcusable. By changing your thinking to value your time at $1,000/hr you learn to say no to things that are not the best use of your time.

## How to think like a programmer

Novice programmers and problem solvers often adopt a trial and error approach and spend little to no time understanding and planning before jumping right into attempting the first thing that comes to their mind. But by being purposeful and having a framework you can efficiently come up with effective solutions.

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Practice

## How to solve programming problems

This article is very similar to the previous one. Don't jump right into coding, especially during coding interviews.

> Read the problem completely twice.
> Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
> Optimize the manual steps.
> Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
> Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
> Optimize the real code.

## 5 Whys: Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

The idea is simple, by looking at a problem answering "why does that problem exist?" and then repeating that process for new answer another four times, you can quickly get to the root and cure the root problem, not just the symptom. This method was developed by Sakchi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota in the 30's and popularized in the 70's. The 5 Whys pair extremely well with Root Cause Analysis, Lean Manufacturing, and Six Sigma.

## The Super Mario Effect

Learning to view percieved "failures" in a neutral, or even better, a positive light allows you to unlock new levels of potential you never knew you had. You will not be tempted to quit, because "failure" is not devastating or permanent, but actually a way to make you strong and better off them youy would have ever been without the failure. Toddler's don't feel embarassed when learning to walk, and no one ultimately remembers the time they fell down a pit in Super Mario World. The success is what stays with them. There is nothing really worth it in life without some risk and failure. But the failure make you stronger, and make the victory that much sweeter.

## Discussion Questions

### One thing I can bring to my career that nobody else can

A unique background in aviation, military leadership, and technical training that will make me able to solve individual problems and coding challenges. But also understand, inspire, and lead others to success in any task or mission.

### 3 things I'll start doing to "un-stick" myself

1. If I encounter a problem I'll break it down it to smaller parts and see if I can solve those smaller components
2. I'll do inpependent research to see what the internet has to say
3. I'll reach out to friends in the course to see if they can answer
4. I'll submit a help ticket in remo to get some help.
