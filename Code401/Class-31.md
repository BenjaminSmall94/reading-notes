## Beginner's Guide to Docker

Docker promises to be the savior of marrying software across operating systems and various production environments. The only cost, you have to learn Docker.

### Linux Containers

If multiple computers are sharing space on a server, each one having its own configuration. However most of the configuations are similar or identical. What if we took advantage of this fact to optimize. This is where Linux containers come into play.

> An analogy we can use here is that of homes and apartments. Virtual Machines are like homes: stand-alone buildings with their own infrastructure including plumbing and heating, as well as a kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and so on. Docker containers are like apartments: they share common infrastructure like plumbing and heating, but come in various sizes that match the exact needs of an owner.

### Docker summed up

- Docker enables the user to run Linux containers which are a less demanding version of virtual environments.
- docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container

## Django for APIs

Django's rest framwork is dependent on Django already being installed.

> A traditional Django website consists of a single project with multiple apps representing discrete functionality.

Make sure you know how to set up a basic django website!

## Things I Want to Know More About

Show me some Dockers in action. But also I want to do a little more independent research on virtual environments. I feel like I know what they're for but don't really understand them all the way. It would be a good place for me to research and expand my knowledge!
