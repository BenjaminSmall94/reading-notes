## Ethics in the Workplace

### The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

This article was particularly compelling for me. He's right that pretty soon we'll be writing code that takes people's kids to soccer practice. This represents the unrelenting trend that software will more and more become are part of our lives, in beneficial, but also more risky and possibly invasive ways. 99% of the population who relies on the software products, have no ability to understand the processes going on behind the scenes and therefore are very vulnerable to injury or exploitation. It is up to ethical software developers to ensure that people's rights are respected and their safety is cared for.

## Ethics in Technology

### Self Driving Car Ethics

There are a ton of ethical questions in building and releasing self driving cars. It's very likely true that self-driving cars offer the promise of severly reducing no-win scenarios by being aware and able to react to these potentially dangerous scenarios long before a human would do so. However the fact that now programmers are having to make life or death decisions while sitting in front of a computer long before such situations arise poses a unique psycological and moral dilemna. But by applying ethical decision making and intelligent problem solving, self driving cars should become a reality within our lifetime. A very exciting time to be in tech indeed.
