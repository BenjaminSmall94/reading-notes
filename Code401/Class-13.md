## Linear Regressions in Python

Linear Regressions is the practice of assigning a linear trendline to a set of data that most effectively approximates the data with proper axis intercepts and slope. This can be accomplished using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn. The interesting thing is that the regression can be done in two dimensions or more!

After importing the appropriate libraries you must load the data that you would like to work with. After formatting the data as you would like you can use a linear regression object to run a linear regression and extrapolate future value based on this model. After you are done you should examine your residuals to determine how well your regression represents the data!

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to see all the different data set we can run this on and find what sort of insights this will lead us to! Also I want to learn how we can use python to tackle intense statistical problems! I also want to practice applying these statistical methods on real world data sets.
