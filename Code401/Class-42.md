## Dunder Methods

Dunder methods, often times called, magic methods, are special pre-defined methods in python that allow custom made objects to have certain very useful behaviors and take advantage of the full spectrum of capabilites that python has built into that language.

Common dunder methods include features such as

> - Initialization of new objects
> - Object representation
> - Enable iteration
> - Operator overloading (comparison)
> - Operator overloading (addition)
> - Method invocation
> - Context manager support (with statement)

## Iterators

> Objects that support the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops.

By building your objects with these special methods, you will enable your objects to be easily accessed by for and in statements in Python.

## Generators

> In this tutorial youâ€™ll see how to write Python iterators faster and with less code using generators and the yield keyword.

Generators are an easier way to implement the iteration feature previously discussed. This can become a huge time saver in certain instances. It can possibly reduce your lines of code required from seven down to one!

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to get practice implementing iterators and generators to quickly and conveniently be able to take advantage of the full array of capabilities Python has built into the language.
