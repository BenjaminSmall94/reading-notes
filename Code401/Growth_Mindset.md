## Deliberate Practice

Just like expert pianist rarely play a song in its entirety, expert developers must be deliberate in their practice to challenge themselves, embrace the struggle and grow in their craft.

## Growth Mindset: Summary

There are two ways of thinking about intelligence;

- An innate fixed quantity that you are born with at birth
- A fluid/maleable volume that can be stretched and increased the practice, discipline, and experience

All your life from the time you are little you learn about rules and limitations. But when you realize that most of these limitaitons are self-impposed you begin to realize you full potential.

Say goodbye to self-doubt, say goodbye to imposter syndrome. Your destiny is in your hands. Your intelligence and ability can grow and expand nearly infinitely.  

> Believe in the `Growth Mindset`  

The journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step. You many not be able to do everything now, but soon you will. You can do this and you do deserve to be here. Believe in yourself and you ability to grow.

## **Things to remind yourself when you struggle with having a growth mindset.**

| Doubt | Remind yourself |
| ----- | --------------- |
| I'm not good at this | No one is good at it when just beginning |
| I made a mistake | That proves you've put in effort, what effort is helpful next? |
| My classmate can do it, why can't I | There was a time they couldn't either, what did they do to get where they are now? |

## Emotional Intelligence

It is very important to cultivate emotional intelligence including self-awareness, social-awareness, self-management, and relationship management. Without these it does not matter how intelligent or book-smart you are, you will not be a good employee or a good person.

## Bias

It is also vital that everyone understands their implicit biases. If you do not, then you will likely percieve people and situations innacurately and behave in sub optimal or possibly completely innapropriate manners. Once you develop this self-awareness, then you can start to treat people much more fairly and equitably.
