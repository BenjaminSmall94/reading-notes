## Intro to Django

### Object-relational mapper

When defining data models in Python you get very extensive database API for free but SQL is still available.

### URLs and views

Python enables effective design of URLs and doesn't put unnecessary crap in there.

### Templates

Django provides easy to use templates for those familiar with HTML. But also has extensive libraries to expand upon pre-canned templates.

### Forms

Django has a very good forms library for taking in user data and converting that into native python data types.

### Authentication

Django also possesses a fullu fledged authentication system for verifying user accounts and storing account information

### Admin

Django supports admin functionality

## How Django Work Behind the Scenes

> Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. The code was open-sourced in 2005 and developers immediately started making contributions to the codebase.

A Non-Profit organization *Django Software Foundation* was founded to promtoe, support, and advance Django.

> If you make a donation to Django–and if you’re using Django professionally you really should–that money goes to the DSF. The majority goes to the Django Fellows who ensure the project remains on track and the rest helps promote Django and expand its community. The total budget for the DSF in 2019 is around $200,000, or less than the cost of a single Bay Area Django engineer.
