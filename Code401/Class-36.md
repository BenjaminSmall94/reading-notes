## Whiteboard Advice

### Communicate Alot

First advice is to communicate alot. Make sure the interviewer knows what is going on in your head. Even if you do not 100% solve the problem they'll understand your thought process and be able to give you credit for you approach. It is helpful to repeat the question and ask for verification to make sure you understood the question before you even start. You should also ask about edge cases, how should they be handled? Do they need to be accounted for? Additonally talking about test cases will give you clarity and time to think about solutions.

### Write Pseudo Code then Actual Code

After doing each step ask the interviewer if they think your solution looks good. They may give you hints that will help you reach a 100% optimal solution

### If stuck ask for help

It's not illegal to ask for help. So ask in a friendly way and they very well might throw you a bone.
