## Pain vs Suffering

I know that Code 401 will not be easy, but the pain is not suffering without purpose. It is the highly condensed learning that is pushing me rapidly towards a better career and life that I desire!

## Beginner's Guide to Big O

There are many types of data complexities of functions. In reality there are infinite possiblities. However there are several that are most common. It is always desirable to solve a problem in the most efficient manner. Complexities include (in order best to worst)

1. O(1): Constant
2. O(log(n)): Logarithmic
3. O(n): Linear
4. O(n\*log(n)): Linear\*Logarithmic
5. O(n^2): Quadratic
6. O(n^3): Cubic
7. O(2^n): Exponential (base 2)

## Names and Values in Python

- Python is usually predictable, except in the strange cases where it is different.
- Names refer to values
- Values live until no references exist to said value
- Assignment NEVER copies data
- Mutable Aliasing uses mutable values, and all names referencing the value changes with it.
- Change can be unclear; rebinding vs mutating
- Names have scope but no type, values have a type but no scope

## Things I want to know more about

I want to continue to learn about what makes python unique and how the all the loops work and what special use functions are natively built in to be used for my convenience.
