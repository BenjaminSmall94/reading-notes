## ES6

Ecmascript 2015 (ES6) is an update to the Javascript language that introduced many new features.

### New Features

- Variable declaration - The keywords of `let` and `const` were introduced, each with their own implications on socpe, hoisting, reassignment and redeclaration.
- Constant declaration
- Arrow function syntax - These are a shorter way to declare functions however they do not have a this and are not hoisted
- Template literals - This made string concatenation much clearer.
- Implicit returns - Strings can now by multiple lines
- Key/property shorthand
- Method definition shorthand
- Destructuring (object matching) - This made grabbing items from objects much easier
- Array iteration (looping) - Built in foreach loops were introduced.
- Default parameters
- Spread syntax
- Classes/constructor functions
- Inheritance
- Modules - export/import
- Promises/callbacks

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to see how React integrates with Frameworks such as Django and all the other tools we learned in the Python course so far to build awesome applications that people will die to use!
