## List Comprehensions

Using list comprehensions is an effective way to up your Python game.

> `my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]`
>
> You can see from this example that three ingredients are necessary for a python list comprehension to work.
>
> 1. First is the expression weâ€™d like to carry out. expression inside the square brackets.
> 2. Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
> 3. Finally, we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. list inside the square brackets.

Effectively this can work as the very common array methods map or filter from Javascript. It can work on many data types such as integers or strings.

Use list comprehension in the following way to use the filter capability

> phone_number = [ x for x in user_data if x.isdigit()]

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to learn more about decorators and use them extensively in my code. It will be very interesting to continue to learn more about them!
