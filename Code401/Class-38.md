## Conidtional Rendering

By using if statements or the ternary operator you can easily change the output of a page in react. This can be based on state, props, or any other previously defined variable. Additionally otgher logical operators can produce conditional rendering as well.

## List and Keys

Using the array map function or standard for loops enable a user to easily transform array or iterable objects into valid HTML to be rendered on the page. When doing this it is important to maintain a key value for each item.

## Forms

React interacts with forms in an interesting way. Typically by updating the state whenever a form is submitted you can seamlessly display the results of form submissions back to the user with very little effort.

## Lifting State

Changing the state of parent components is done by accessing set methods that are passed down to child components through the props object.

## Composition vs Inheritance

> React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

The concecpts of containment and specialization are extremely beneficial to the use of react applications.

## Thinking in React

0. Start with a mock
1. Break the UI into a componenent hierarchy
2. Build a static version in react
3. Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state
4. Identify where your state should live
5. Add inverse data flow

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to know more about how python and frameworks like django interact with frameworks like Next.js and React and build a web application that takes advantage of everything I have learned in all my classes.
