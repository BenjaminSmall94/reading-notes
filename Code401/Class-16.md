## What is Serverless Computing

An application and development model that lets developers build and run code without having to manage servers and pay for idle cloud resources. This lets developers put all their focus into developing the best front end code possible. The cloud provider manages everything on the backend and only charges for the resources used. However serverless is not truly serverless, this nomenclature comes form the the description of the developers perspective. Some of the big facets of serverless computing include:

- Serverless databases and storage:
- Event streaming and messaging
- API gatewasy

### Serverless vs other common infrastructures

- Provisioning time: orders of magnitude faster
- Administrative burder: None for serverless, some for other platforms
- Maintenance: Serverless is 100% offered by provider
- Scaling - Only pay for what you use

## Things I Want to Know More About

I want to see serverless computing in practice. See how it really performs and how convenient it is to the developer and how it compares to other common infrastructures.
