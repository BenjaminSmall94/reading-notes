# Let's make this file be displayed

I think that the README file should only be for coders to read
While I think that this display fire should be the one that is being put on gh-pages

## Reasons why I think that

1. README files are for explaining what a piece of code is for
2. Other files are for dsiplaying.
    - This file is for displaying
3. I rest my case
